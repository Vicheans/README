Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Victor, a freelance developer based in Nigeria, specialized in React and ReactNative.

I've been a React early-adopter, since September 2019.

Iâ€™m currently working on Fun School Portal, a React-Gatsby-based static site generator with a focus on experience.

I like:

remote work: since 2019
flexibility and Trust: 
I work for people that care about outcomes
interesting Projects: 
I choose carefully, to keep learning
Part-time: 
working on more projects gives a broad experience
consulting, coaching, training, audits: 
The best ROI for my customers, and a higher rate for me
I'm on a path that's wholesomely different than most Nigerian contractors (on-site, full-time, multi-years contracts).

Currently, I'm available for hire, I can also work remotely as I've handled a coupled of Projects for clients I never got to meet in Person :)

Content creation
Despite a large experience of the whole React ecosystem, I didn't produce much content between 2015 and 2020.

Lately, I'm working on putting out Helpful Contents, to write more, and to follow the Learn In Public mantra.

For now the platform I focus on the most is Twitter, and I'm also hoping to Improve my LinkedIn reach.

I'm also trying to find a good workflow to produce more detailed blog posts, and content for The Tech Community and also to reach a broader audience.

With time I do to Impact a lot of Lives as I've Imagined :)
